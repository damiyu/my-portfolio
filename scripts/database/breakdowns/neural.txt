# Purpose:
I plan to specialize in machine learning, so it would be vital to understand both the framework and implementation of different models.
After taking introductory courses in machine learning and deep learning at UCSD, I want to explore a "vanilla" implementation of a neural network.
An FCN is a good starting point because it is simple and is the foundation for other high-order models like CNNs, BERTs, and GPTs.
Because a lot of linear algebra and calculus is involved, I hope to improve my math skills.
