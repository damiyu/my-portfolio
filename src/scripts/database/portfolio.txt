# Purpose:
The courses I took in college has exposed me to advanced data structures + algorithms, computer architecture, software development, machine learning, etc.
After taking these classes, I wanted to create independent projects to showcase my knowledge.
These projects were a way to retain my skills while exploring more advanced sections of each concept.
Originally, I was going to use open-source templates to quickly generate a website to host my projects.
Instead, I decided to create my portfolio from scratch so I can improve my JavaScript/HTML5/CSS3 skills.
Additionally, I got the opportunity to explore new tools like web APIs, Figma, and React.js.

# Concept and User Interface:
For my portfolio, I wanted a simple website to give a brief introduction about myself and host my projects.
I used Figma to design a layout of my webpages and their contents.

# Back-End Development:
Stuff in the back.

```Code
function loadingScreen(n) {
    // Perform three bubble bounces (1 second apart) before stopping and revealing the project contents.
    if (n[6]++ < 3) {
        bubbleBounce();
        setTimeout(loadingScreen, 1000, n);
    }
}
```
